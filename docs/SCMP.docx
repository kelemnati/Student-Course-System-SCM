SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN (SCMP)

Project Title: Student Login & Course List System
Course: Software Configuration Management
Team Size: 7 Members
Repository: https://github.com/kelemnati/Student-Course-System-SCM
Date: December 2025


1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Purpose
This Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP) defines the processes, roles, tools, and procedures used to manage configuration items for the Student Login & Course List System project. The plan ensures systematic control of changes, versioning, baselines, and releases throughout the project lifecycle.

1.2 Scope
This SCMP applies to all project artifacts including documentation, source code, configuration files, test artifacts, baselines, and releases. The plan governs activities from initial repository setup to final release and audit.

1.3 Project Overview
The Student Login & Course List System is a simple web-based application consisting of a login page, a course listing module, core features such as search and favorite courses, and a simple database or JSON-based backend. The project focuses on applying SCM principles rather than developing a production-level system.


2. SCM MANAGEMENT

2.1 SCM Organization and Roles

Role: Team Leader  
Responsibilities:
- Overall SCM coordination
- Baseline and release management
- Approval of change requests

Role: Developer 1  
Responsibilities:
- Login module implementation
- Feature branch development

Role: Developer 2  
Responsibilities:
- Course list and search feature implementation

Role: Developer 3  
Responsibilities:
- Backend and favorite courses feature implementation

Role: Change Manager  
Responsibilities:
- Manage Change Request (CR) forms
- Maintain Change Log
- Track CR status

Role: QA / Auditor  
Responsibilities:
- Prepare test checklist
- Conduct PCA and FCA audits
- Verify CR implementation


3. CONFIGURATION IDENTIFICATION

3.1 Configuration Items (CIs)
Configuration Items include all artifacts placed under configuration control, such as:
- SCM Plan (SCMP)
- CI Register
- Change Request Forms
- Change Log
- Source code files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Database or JSON files
- Audit reports
- Release notes

3.2 CI Identification and Naming Convention
CIs are identified using the following format:

CI-XX  : Configuration Item Identifier  
CR-XXX : Change Request Identifier  
BLX    : Baseline Identifier  
vX.X   : Release Version  

Example:
CI-06 – Course List Page  
CR-002 – Favorite Courses Feature  
BL2 – Functional Baseline  


4. VERSION CONTROL

4.1 Version Control Tools
- Git is used for version control
- GitHub is used for repository hosting and collaboration

4.2 Repository Structure

/docs       – Documentation files  
/src        – Source code  
/tests      – Test artifacts  
/releases   – Release notes and packages  

4.3 Branching Strategy
The project follows a feature-based branching model:

- main
- feature-login
- feature-course
- feature-course-search
- feature-favorites

Rules:
- No direct commits to main branch
- All development occurs in feature branches
- Changes are merged via Pull Requests only


5. CHANGE CONTROL PROCESS

5.1 Change Request Procedure
1. Change Request is submitted using CR Form
2. Impact analysis is performed
3. Change is reviewed and approved
4. Implementation is done in a feature branch
5. Testing and verification are performed
6. Pull Request is merged into main
7. Change is recorded in Change Log

5.2 Implemented Change Requests
- CR-001: Add Course Search Functionality
- CR-002: Add Favorite Courses Feature
- CR-003: Backend and Data Handling Improvements


6. BASELINE MANAGEMENT

6.1 Baseline Definition
A baseline is a formally approved snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.

6.2 Project Baselines

Baseline 1 (BL1):
- Repository structure
- Initial documentation
- CI Register

Baseline 2 (BL2):
- Working prototype
- Implemented CRs
- Tested features

Baselines are created and tracked using Git tags.


7. RELEASE MANAGEMENT

7.1 Release Strategy
Releases represent stable versions of the system delivered to stakeholders.

7.2 Project Releases

Release v1.0:
- Login functionality
- Course list module

Release v1.1:
- Course search feature
- Favorite courses feature
- CR implementations

Release notes are documented and published through GitHub Releases.


8. CONFIGURATION STATUS ACCOUNTING

Configuration status is tracked using:
- Git commit history
- Pull Requests
- CI Register
- Change Log
- Baseline and release tags


9. CONFIGURATION AUDIT

9.1 Physical Configuration Audit (PCA)
Ensures:
- All documents exist in the repository
- CI names and versions are consistent
- Baselines and releases are correctly tagged

9.2 Functional Configuration Audit (FCA)
Ensures:
- Approved CRs are implemented
- System functionality matches requirements
- No unauthorized changes exist


10. TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

- Git
- GitHub
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Node.js / JSON
- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft Excel


11. ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

- Authentication is static and for demonstration only
- Passwords are not encrypted
- Database integration is minimal
- System is not production-ready
- Focus is on SCM practices rather than full functionality


12. CONCLUSION

This Software Configuration Management Plan provides a structured approach to managing configuration items, changes, baselines, and releases for the Student Login & Course List System. The defined SCM practices ensure traceability, consistency, and auditability throughout the project lifecycle.
