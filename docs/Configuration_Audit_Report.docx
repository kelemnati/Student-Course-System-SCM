1. Introduction

This Configuration Audit Report documents the results of the Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) conducted for the Student Login & Course List System. The objective of this audit is to ensure that all Configuration Items (CIs) are correctly identified, documented, versioned, and implemented in accordance with the approved Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP).

The audit verifies compliance with defined baselines, approved Change Requests (CRs), and release versions.
