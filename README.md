# Student Login & Course List System

## Project Overview

This project is a simple academic system developed to demonstrate
Software Configuration Management (SCM) concepts using Git and GitHub.
It includes a login module, course list module, and basic user actions.

## Features

- User login (demo authentication)
- Course list display
- Course search functionality
- Favorite courses feature

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js (basic backend simulation)
- JSON / simple database

## Known Limitations & Assumptions

- Authentication is static and intended for demonstration purposes only.
- Passwords are not encrypted and should not be used in production.
- Database integration is minimal and used only to simulate backend behavior.
- The system is not optimized for scalability or security.
- This project focuses on Software Configuration Management processes rather than full system functionality.

## SCM Focus

The primary goal of this project is to apply SCM practices such as
branching, baselines, change control, configuration auditing,
and release management.
