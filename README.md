SCM Mini Project – Software Engineering Department

This project demonstrates the application of Software Configuration Management (SCM)
principles using Git and GitHub.

Focus is on SCM processes, not programming complexity.

## Branching Rules

- Direct commits to main are not allowed
- All changes must be done in feature branches
- Pull Requests are required for merging

## Baselines

- BL1: Repository setup and SCM documentation

## Known Limitations & Assumptions

- Authentication is static and intended for demonstration purposes only.
- Passwords are not encrypted and should not be used in production.
- Database integration is minimal and used only to simulate backend behavior.
- The system is not optimized for scalability or security.
- This project focuses on Software Configuration Management processes rather than full system functionality.
